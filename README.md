# byNolo Site

This repository serves as my personal portfolio and project launcher for the byNolo brand. It showcases my work and provides a central hub to access and launch all byNolo projects. The site is built using React and Vite for the frontend, with a Python backend API.

## Project Structure

- `src/` - React frontend source code
- `api/` - Python backend API (Flask or similar)
- `public/` - Static assets
- `index.html` - Main HTML file

## Getting Started


### Frontend
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:

### Backend
1. Create a Python virtual environment and activate it.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r api/requirements.txt
